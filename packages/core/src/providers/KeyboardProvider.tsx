/**
 * KeyboardProvider - App-wide keyboard state tracking.

 * - iOS: keyboard events report full height; safe area inset is subtracted
 *   to avoid double-padding.
 * - Android: `windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` handles most cases; this
 *   provider supplements with explicit height tracking.
